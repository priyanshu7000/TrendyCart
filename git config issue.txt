I worked on this project entirely by myself, but since I was using a company system that had been previously configured
with another user’s GitHub account, the commits were initially showing under their name. 
I forgot to change the local Git configuration before pushing my code, which is why the contributions appeared as if 
they belonged to someone else. 
After realizing this, I corrected the Git configuration to my own GitHub account and rewrote 
the commit history so that all contributions are now correctly attributed to me. This project is completely 
my work and the commit history mismatch happened only because of the system’s pre-existing Git setup.
